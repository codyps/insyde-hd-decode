On Acer laptops using Insyde EFI, if a HD password is set, after failing to
enter the password a few times, a "Key" or "Code" of 8 digits is added to the
prompt. With those 8 digits, a password to unlock the harddrive can be fairly
trivially derived allowing someone who does not know the HD password to access
the HD.

This is a very good reason not to use the HD password mechanism as a security
feature even if your drive supports using it as an encryption key (as the
Samsung 840 and 840 pro supposedly do).

This utility allows decoding the Key. The coding turns out to be a trivial
mapping of digits depending on the digits possition.

See selected-code-dump for the info used to construct the lookup table. The
format of that file is "displayed code: decoded code".

On my Acer ao725, the Key is displayed after 3 HD password entry failures, and
when the decoded unlock password is entered, the hd password prompt is disabled
for future boots.
